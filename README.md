# Löve2D Project Preset

This is a small helper repository to get you started coding a nice game with Löve2D.

## Requirements

* Makefile and Bash scripts are not good for Windows, don't you try to feed them to the nasty Microsoft stuff. For Linux only!
* You should have Löve2D installed on your system, so you don't have to build the binary package all the time for testing

## Building

The following make targets are available:

    clean:  clears all generated data
    build:  packages the data and sources into ```game.love```
    run:    runs ```love game.love``` for you
    package-all:    creates all binary packages into ```pkg/```
    package-<platform>: generates binary package for one of the supported platforms

Just type ```make``` to perform the **build** and **run** targets.

## Development

Put your data in the ```data/``` folder, and your sources into ```src/```. Make sure to adjust ```src/config.lua```. Add resources to the resource manager in ```src/main.lua```. You can access them via

    resources.images.<image-name>
    resources.fonts.<font-name>
    etc...

from everywhere in your code.

### Class Helper

The class helper can be used like this:

    require("util/helper")

    ClassName = class("ClassName")

    function ClassName:__init(constructor, arguments)
        self.foo = "bar"
    end

    function ClassName:customMethod(parameter)
        -- do stuff
    end

Inheritance works like this:

    require("util/helper")

    SecondClass = class("SecondClass", ClassName)

    -- overwriting a method
    function SecondClass:customMethod(parameter_x)
        -- do other stuff
    end

### Game States

To create a new game state, inherit it from the GameState class (util/gamestate). Then create it in the reset() function in the ```src/main.lua```. To switch to a state, call stack:push(the_state) somewhere in your code. To close a state, run stack:pop(). See the intro state in ```src/intro.lua``` for an example.
